# Lead Scoring Case Study - Upgrad
Problem Statement

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. They have process of form filling on their website after which the company that individual as a lead. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc.Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Now, this means if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as Hot Leads.If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone

Business Objective

Lead X wants us to build a model to give every lead a lead score between 0 -100 . So that they can identify the Hot leads and increase their conversion rate as well. The CEO want to achieve a lead conversion rate of 80%. They want the model to be able to handle future constraints as well like Peak time actions required, how to utilize full man power and after achieving target what should be the approaches.

Goal of the Case Study

There are quite a few goals for this case study:

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.

Solution

This Repository contains a well-commented python notebook, a word file answering all the questions asked by the company, a presentation having the analysis of the case study and a summary report that gives a walk through on how the problem was approached
